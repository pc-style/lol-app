# Champion Select Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ **What's Currently Working**

### **UI & User Experience:**
- ‚úÖ **Champion Select Detection**: App automatically switches to champion select mode
- ‚úÖ **Champion Grid**: Shows all owned champions with search and filtering
- ‚úÖ **Turn Detection**: Shows "Your PICK" or "Your BAN" indicators
- ‚úÖ **Visual Feedback**: Champion selection highlights and updates
- ‚úÖ **Lock-In Button**: Button appears and responds to clicks
- ‚úÖ **Team Composition**: Shows both teams and their picks
- ‚úÖ **Timer Display**: Shows champion select phase timer

### **Backend Integration:**
- ‚úÖ **LCU Connection**: Successfully connects to League Client
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Updates**: Receives champion select events
- ‚úÖ **Champion Data**: Loads 54+ owned champions
- ‚úÖ **Session Data**: Gets champion select session information
- ‚úÖ **Action Detection**: Identifies current player actions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Status: Mock Implementation**

### **Champion Lock-In Functionality:**
```
Status: SIMULATION MODE
- Clicking champions logs the selection
- Lock-in button returns success response
- No actual League Client interaction yet
```

**Console Output When Working:**
```
Picking champion 63 for action 0
Champion pick simulation - would pick champion 63 for action 0

Lock-in simulation for action 0
```

## üîß **Technical Challenge**

### **Hexgate HTTP Client Issue:**
The main challenge is accessing the correct HTTP client method from hexgate:

**Attempts Made:**
1. ‚ùå `this.lcuConnection.https.request()` - Method doesn't exist
2. ‚ùå `this.lcuConnection.https.fetch()` - Method doesn't exist
3. ‚ùå `this.lcuConnection.https()` - Not a function
4. ‚ùå `this.lcuConnection.https.PATCH()` - Method doesn't exist

**Root Cause:**
The hexgate library's HTTP client API is not well-documented for direct access. The `Connection` class abstracts away the raw HTTP methods.

## üéØ **Working Solution Approaches**

### **Option 1: Use Raw Node.js HTTPS (Recommended)**
```javascript
import https from 'https';

// Get LCU credentials from hexgate
const credentials = this.lcuConnection.credentials;

// Make raw HTTPS request to LCU
const options = {
  hostname: '127.0.0.1',
  port: credentials.port,
  path: `/lol-champ-select/v1/session/actions/${actionId}`,
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Basic ${Buffer.from(`riot:${credentials.password}`).toString('base64')}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  rejectUnauthorized: false // LCU uses self-signed certs
};
```

### **Option 2: Use Axios with LCU Auth**
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const lcuAuth = {
  username: 'riot',
  password: credentials.password
};

const response = await axios.patch(
  `https://127.0.0.1:${port}/lol-champ-select/v1/session/actions/${actionId}`,
  { championId },
  { 
    auth: lcuAuth,
    httpsAgent: new https.Agent({ rejectUnauthorized: false })
  }
);
```

### **Option 3: Extend Hexgate Recipe System**
Create specific recipe functions that work within hexgate's type system.

## üöÄ **Current User Experience**

**For Testing the UI:**
1. ‚úÖ Start the app and League of Legends
2. ‚úÖ Enter champion select
3. ‚úÖ See real-time champion select interface
4. ‚úÖ Click champions to "select" them (logs to console)
5. ‚úÖ Click "Lock In" button (returns success simulation)

**What Users See:**
- Professional champion select interface
- Real-time updates and turn detection
- Responsive champion grid with search/filter
- Team composition visualization
- All UI elements working perfectly

## üìã **Next Steps**

### **To Complete Full Implementation:**
1. **Extract LCU Credentials**: Get port and password from hexgate connection
2. **Implement Raw HTTPS**: Use Node.js https module for direct LCU calls
3. **Add Error Handling**: Handle network failures and API errors
4. **Test Integration**: Verify actual champion picking works
5. **Remove Mock Code**: Replace simulation with real API calls

### **For Production:**
- Add retry logic for failed requests  
- Implement request timeout handling
- Add user feedback for API errors
- Cache champion select state locally
- Add offline mode graceful degradation

## üéÆ **User Value**

**Even with mock implementation, users get:**
- ‚úÖ **Visual Champion Select Helper**: Better than in-game interface
- ‚úÖ **Champion Search & Filter**: Find champions quickly
- ‚úÖ **Team Composition View**: See picks and bans clearly
- ‚úÖ **Turn Notifications**: Know when it's your turn
- ‚úÖ **Professional UI**: League-themed, responsive interface

The core user experience is complete - only the final API integration remains!
