# Champion Lock-In Functionality - Implementation Guide

## ‚úÖ **What's Now Working:**

### üéÆ **Champion Picking & Locking**
- **Click to Pick**: Click any champion card to automatically pick it for your current action
- **Lock In Button**: "Lock In [Champion]" button now actually locks in your selected champion
- **Ban Support**: Button changes to "Ban [Champion]" during ban phases and executes bans
- **Real-time Actions**: Detects your current champion select action (pick/ban) and responds accordingly

### üîß **Technical Implementation:**

#### **Main Process (src/main/main.ts):**
```javascript
// Added IPC handlers for champion select actions:
- pick-champion: Uses LCU API PATCH /lol-champ-select/v1/session/actions/{actionId}
- lock-in-champion: Uses LCU API POST /lol-champ-select/v1/session/actions/{actionId}/complete  
- ban-champion: Uses LCU API PATCH /lol-champ-select/v1/session/actions/{actionId}
```

#### **Renderer Process (src/renderer/components/ChampionSelect.tsx):**
```javascript
// Added functions:
- handleChampionPick(): Automatically picks champion when clicking card
- handleLockIn(): Locks in the selected champion 
- handleBanChampion(): Bans the selected champion
- getCurrentAction(): Gets the current pending action for the player
```

#### **IPC Bridge (src/main/preload.ts):**
```javascript
// Exposed to renderer:
- window.electronAPI.pickChampion(actionId, championId)
- window.electronAPI.lockInChampion(actionId)
- window.electronAPI.banChampion(actionId, championId)
```

## üéØ **How It Works:**

### **During Champion Select:**
1. **Action Detection**: App detects if it's your turn to pick/ban based on champion select session data
2. **Champion Selection**: Click any owned champion card to immediately pick it
3. **Visual Feedback**: Selected champion highlights and shows in the details panel
4. **Lock In**: Click "Lock In [Champion Name]" to finalize your pick
5. **Ban Phase**: During bans, button changes to "Ban [Champion Name]" and executes ban instead

### **Smart UI Features:**
- **Turn Indicator**: Shows "Your PICK" or "Your BAN" when it's your turn
- **Button State**: Lock In button is disabled when it's not your turn
- **Action Context**: Button text changes based on current action type (pick vs ban)
- **Error Handling**: Console logs for debugging, graceful error handling

## üêõ **Debugging:**

### **Console Logs:**
When using the app, check the console (main process terminal) for:
```
Picking champion: [ChampionName] (ID: [ID]) for action: [ActionID]
Locking in champion: [ChampionName] for action: [ActionID]  
Banning champion: [ChampionName] (ID: [ID]) for action: [ActionID]
```

### **Common Issues:**
- **"No active action available"**: You're not currently in a pick/ban phase
- **Network errors**: LCU connection might be unstable
- **Action ID errors**: Champion select session data might be out of sync

## üöÄ **Usage:**

### **To Test:**
1. **Start League & App**: Ensure both are running and connected
2. **Enter Champion Select**: Queue up for any game mode
3. **Wait for Turn**: App will show "Your PICK" or "Your BAN" 
4. **Click Champion**: Click any champion card to pick it
5. **Lock In**: Click "Lock In [Champion]" to confirm

### **Expected Behavior:**
- **Instant Pick**: Champion appears in your slot immediately after clicking
- **Successful Lock**: Champion becomes locked and turn advances to next player
- **Visual Updates**: UI updates in real-time with your selections

## üîÆ **Future Enhancements:**

- **Pre-pick**: Allow picking champions before it's your turn (intent)
- **Hover Preview**: Show champion details on hover
- **Pick Recommendations**: AI-powered champion suggestions
- **Team Sync**: Show recommended picks based on team composition
- **Ban Strategy**: Suggest strategic bans based on enemy picks
