Quick workflow to add all changes, commit, and push to current branch.

!`git status --porcelain`
!`git branch --show-current`

Please:
1. Add all changes with `git add .`
2. Create a meaningful commit message based on the changes shown above
3. Commit the changes
4. Push to the current branch (create upstream if needed)
